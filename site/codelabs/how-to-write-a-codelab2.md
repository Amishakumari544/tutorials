## Setting Duration
Duration: 2

To indicate how long each slide will take to go through, set the `Duration` under each Heading 2 (i.e. `##`) to an integer. 
The integers refer to minutes. If you set `Duration: 4` then a particular slide will take 4 minutes to complete. 

The total time will automatically be calculated for you and will be displayed on the codelab once you create it.
