## Bring your own Kubernetes cluster

Keptn can be installed on a variety of Kubernetes distributions. Please find a full compatibility matrix for supported Kubernetes versions [here](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.7.x/installation/k8s-support/).

Please find tutorials [how to set up your cluster here](../../?cat=installation).

Positive
: Please note that if you are following one of the installation tutorials, only steps ①-③ are needed (setup of cluster) since we are going to install Keptn as part of this tutorial.
