Thanks for taking a full tour through Keptn!
Although Keptn has even more to offer that should have given you a good overview what you can do with Keptn.

### What we've covered

- We have created a sample project with the Keptn CLI and set up a multi-stage delivery pipeline with the `shipyard` file
- We have onboarded our first microservice
- We used a blue/green deployment to deploy the service 
- We have set up Dynatrace to monitor our applications
- We have set up quality gates based on service level objectives
- We have tested our quality gates by deploying a bad build to our cluster and verified that Keptn quality gates stopped them.
- We have set up self-healing to automatically scale our application 
- We have learned how to extend our Keptn installation with other tools
